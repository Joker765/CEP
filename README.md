### CEP: Computational Endoscopy Platform

Computational Endoscopy Platform (CEP) provides an exhaustive deep learning toolset to handle tasks such as haustral fold annotation, surface coverage visualization, depth estimation and more. As more tools are created they will be added here to create a accessible set of algorithms for endoscopy problems. The current tools are as follows listed below.

-FoldIt


### FoldIt

The FoldIt model is a method for translating between domains when a shared common domain in available. We use the FoldIt model to learn a translation from optical colonoscopy to haustral fold annotation via a common virtual colonoscopy domain.
